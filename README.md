# BioWaste-Supply-Chain

<h2>Goal</h2>
Design and implement a system that improves transparency and accountability in the biowaste supply chain using Blockchain.

<h2>Biowaste Supply Chain</h2>
Waste Generators -> Waste Collectors -> Waste Transporters -> Waste Treatment Facilities -> Regulators -> Auditors

<h2>System Actors</h2>
<h3>Waste Generators</h3>
-> generate biowaste.

<h3>Waste Collectors</h3>
-> collect biowaste from waste generators.

<h3>Waste Transporters</h3>
-> transport biowaste from waste collectors to waste treatment facilities.

<h3>Waste Treatment Facilities</h3>
-> treat biowaste using various methods such as composting, anaerobic digestion, or incineration.

<h3>Regulators</h3>
-> enforce regulations related to biowaste management.

<h3>Auditors</h3>
-> verify compliance with regulations and standards.

<h2>1. Problem</h2>
Lack of transparency in the biowaste supply chain.
<h2>Solution</h2>
Use blockchain to record data points such as the origin and destination of the biowaste, the quantity and quality of the biowaste, and the treatment method used. This data can be transparently viewed by all actors in the supply chain.

<h2>2. Problem</h2>
Fraudulent claims of biowaste disposal and treatment.
<h2>Solution</h2>
Use blockchain to cryptographically verify the disposal and treatment of biowaste. Smart contracts can be used to automate payments to waste collectors and treatment facilities once the disposal and treatment of biowaste have been verified on the blockchain.

<h2>3. Problem</h2> 
Difficulty in tracking biowaste and ensuring its proper disposal.
<h2>Solution</h2>
Blockchain can be used to track the movement of biowaste from waste generators to treatment facilities, and to ensure its proper disposal by verifying compliance with regulations and standards at each stage of the supply chain. This can improve accountability and reduce environmental harm.
